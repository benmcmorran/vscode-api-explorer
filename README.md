# VS Code API Explorer

![demo](resources/demo.gif)

This extension adds a new "VS Code API Explorer" terminal profile. Unlike a normal Node REPL, it is hosted directly in the VS Code extension host process and has access to the VS Code API through the predefined `vscode` variable. This makes it easy to experiment with the API or better understand edge cases that aren't covered in the documentation.
